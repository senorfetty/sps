            SPS provides property managers and their residents with a 7 day a week, 12 hours per
            Day, convenient dispatch number. From 6:00pm – 6:00am you and your residents can call
            the dispatch number and one of our senior security officers will react and respond in minutes.
            Avery important detail to this benefit is that SPS Security Services will respond to this call
            even if we are not patrolling your property for that evening. We want you and your residents
            10
            to feel safe and secure at all times, even when we are not on patrol duty. Another way that
            the Dispatch number has worked well for our clients is when a Resident may have
            information on illegal activity but may want to remain anonymous. In such cases, the resident
            could simply call the dispatch number and tell us of the activity, and we would handle the
            situation and follow the proper Protocol without ever revealing the identity of the caller

            Although we are firm Believers of supporting the growth of one’s community, we do not feel that
            alone should be the deciding factor in picking your security company. If you should pick an out
            of area Security Company, what should happen if they become sick or injured on the job? How
            quickly will they be replaced? Can their shift be covered on the day or evening of the event?
            Can Recruiters be called to back up the security in case of rioting or such challenging events?
            When the blackout occurred a Couple of years ago, all of our properties wanted double or Triple
            coverage with little or no notice. We respond in all cases in less than one hour and in most
            cases, in just minutes. We attribute that to a Couple of things. First, our security guards realize
            our Company believes in reacting and responding, our neighbors need us and we come running
            and second, we are a local Company. We highly recommend a local company.

          We as a company made a commitment to ourselves and our Clients that we will provide
          the best security we can and in doing so, it includes paying our staff more than a mediocre
          Wage. How does this benefit you? We think that if we properly Hire, train, and pay quality
          security it will be a reflection of our service. For years we’ve heard people mention that
          Doctors, police officers, firefighters, and teachers are underpaid and at times their
          performance may suffer because of that. We want our security officers to be more than
          bodies in Uniforms. You can feel confident that we hire and train only the best and it will show
          in our performance for your property and your residents.
